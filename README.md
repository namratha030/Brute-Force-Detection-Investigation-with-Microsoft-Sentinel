# Brute Force Detection & Investigation with Microsoft Sentinel

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to detect and investigate brute force attacksâ€”where attackers repeatedly try multiple username/password combinations to gain unauthorized accessâ€”using **Microsoft Azure Sentinel**. By connecting Azure Virtual Machine logs to Sentinel, creating custom analytics rules with Kusto Query Language (KQL), and visualizing attack patterns, security teams can monitor and respond effectively to login-based threats in real time.

## What is a Brute Force Attack?

A brute force attack is a cyberattack method where an attacker systematically attempts numerous combinations of usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access. These attacks typically manifest as a high number of failed login attempts within a short timeframe, which can be detected via security logs.

## How Microsoft Sentinel Helps

Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud-native Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform that:

- Collects security logs from Azure Virtual Machines (Windows/Linux)
- Analyzes logs in real time using custom Analytics Rules built with Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Detects suspicious behavior such as brute force login attempts
- Generates alerts and incidents for security teams to investigate
- Provides Workbooks to visualize attack patterns and metrics on customizable dashboards

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Azure Portal  
- Microsoft Sentinel (Azure Defender for SIEM)  
- Log Analytics Workspace (LAWS)  
- Azure Virtual Machines (Windows/Linux)  
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)

## Project Objectives

- Connect virtual machines to Azure Sentinel through Log Analytics Workspace  
- Collect security logs related to login attempts  
- Create KQL-based custom Analytics Rules to detect brute force attack patterns  
- Trigger alerts and manage incidents based on detection  
- Visualize login failures and attacker details on Sentinel Workbooks  
- Lay groundwork for automating responses such as blocking suspicious IPs
